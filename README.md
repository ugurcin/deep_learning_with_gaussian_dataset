# deep_learning_with_gaussian_dataset
In this notebook, we first create normally distributed data in 2D, and then fit neural networks with 1 hidden layer to this data to understand how the number of neurons in the hidden layer affect performance.

Secondly, we fix the neural network, but vary the 'mean' of our normally distributed data to see how the loss function changes.
